# Procedural-Road
Procedural road generator made in Unity.

In this "game", you put nodes on the ground hitting the "LEFT CONTROL" key and it generates a road between the nodes. When 3 o more nodes are put on the ground, we use the bezier curve to make a curve.

To test it:

- Hit play.
- Put nodes with "Left Control".
- Move the camera with "AWSD" and "QE".
